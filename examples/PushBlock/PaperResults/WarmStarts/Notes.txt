The Nominal Data

The data in this directory were generated using the scripts in this directory.
The _Nominal data set was generated using PushBlock_Robust_NCP_Nominal.m
with a straight line trajectory as an initial guess and a running cost that
penalized control and state magnitudes squared. 

The optimization was run with the following parameters:
    Major Optimality: 1e-6
    Major Feasibility: 1e-6
    Minor Feasibility: 1e-3

Contact was solved using the standard Nonlinear Complementarity model.

The optimization halted without any exit status; however, there are large 
deviations in the normal force that are not representitive of the underlying
physical phenomenon. This oscillation necessitated the refined data below.

Remarks:
    The nominal optimization only works with a running cost that penalizes 
    state and control magnitudes. Penalizing the deviation from the end state
    results in an unuseable final trajectory and exit messaged. Optimizing
    without a running cost results in a long running optimization. Other 
    attempts to change the parameters of the optimization also result in 
    exit statuses from SNOPT.

The NominalRefined Data

The data in _NominalRefined were generated using PushBlock_Robust_NCP_NominalRefined.mat
with the _Nominal.mat data as a warm start. The running cost penalized state
deviations from the final position and the control magnitude, with an extra
weight of 100 placed on the control magnitudes. 

The optimization was run with the following parameters:
    Major Optimality: 1e-8
    Major Feasibility: 1e-8
    Minor Feasibility: 1e-3

The optimization halted after 11 seconds with no exit status. The resulting 
forces show no large variation; all variation is on the order of 10^-10.
