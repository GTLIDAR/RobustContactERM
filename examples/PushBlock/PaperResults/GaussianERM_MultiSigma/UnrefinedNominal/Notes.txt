All the data in this folder was collected using a Gaussian ERM for friction
coefficient uncertainty in the Push Block example. The relevant script is 
PushBlock_Robust_MultipleSigma.m

The SNOPT settings were:
    Major Optimality: 1e-8
    Major Feasibility: 1e-8
    Minor Feasibility: 1e-6
    Scale Option: 1
    Iterations Limit: 50,000
    Elastic Weight: 10^4
    Major Iterations Limit: 5000
    Superbasics Limit: 1500

The running cost penalizes state differences from the final state, and the 
control cost is 100 times more than the state cost. 

All examples use Backward Euler Integration.

The Uncertainty parameters are
    Friction Coefficient: 0.5
    Uncertainty: Logarithmically scaled between 0.0001 and 1

ERM Cost Multiplier was 1,000,000

All trials converged with no exit status. Most converged in about 1 minute, 
while some converged only after 200 seconds. The final trial converged after
8 seconds.


Remarks:
    A better nominal trajectory would make the figures look nicer. 
    
    For sigma < 0.01, the ERM trajectories converge to the nominal trajectory
        - Will need to verify this with a log plot of sigma and divergence, 
          but it looks that way

    For moderate uncertainty (0.01 < sigma < 1), the behavior is to shorten
    the duration the block slides. This has the effect of reducing the cost 
    associated with the unknown friction cone

    For large sigma (sigma = 1), the solution devolves into a bang-bang 
    controller, and there is no tangential force (for some reason). There is 
    normal force, so the block is still on the surface and should incur some
    frictional force. A check of the vertical displacement of the block also
    confirms that there should be frictional force. 

    The files in the subdirectory FewerTestValues contain similar results, 
    simply sampled only at the powers of 10.
